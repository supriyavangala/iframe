        <h2>Margo and Froggy: A Game of Hide and Seek - Ep 7</h2>
        <p>
          On a bright morning, Little Margo played hide-and-seek with her friend
          Froggy by the pond. Froggy hopped behind lily pads and splashed into
          the water, while Margo giggled, searching carefully. Each time she
          found him, Froggy croaked happily, and together they laughed at their
          playful game. It was a perfect day of friendship and fun.

        <h2>Margo and Duckie - Ep 8</h2>
        <p>
          Later, Margo met a family of ducklings—Ducklies—waddling in the
          meadow. She gently guided them back toward the stream, and the
          Ducklies followed her as if she were their leader. Their tiny quacks
          made Margo smile, and she felt proud to be part of their little
          adventure.

        <h2>Margo and the Flowers - Ep 9</h2>
        <p>
          In the garden, Margo loved to spend time with the flowers. She
          believed each blossom had a secret story to tell. The daisies
          whispered joy, the roses spoke of courage, and the tulips shared
          kindness. Margo watered them with care, and the flowers seemed to bow
          in gratitude, turning the garden into her magical kingdom.
